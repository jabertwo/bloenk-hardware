About
--
Blönk is an universal RGB light attached to the USB port. Originally designt as notifier for the Microsoft Lync software, Blönk now can be used for many other applications.

Flexibility
--
You can ether integrate Blönk into your own projects by using the .NET Library (or commandline software) or you can use Blönk with the already build software as Microsoft Lync notifier.

Software
--
You can find the sourcecode for the .NET library and software (also Lync integration) in a separate repository: https://github.com/johannes85/bloenk-software  
I also published more details about the project on my YouTube channel and website (in German):
